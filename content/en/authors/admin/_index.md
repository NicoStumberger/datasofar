I have been practicing Data Science since before I even knew the term but I started studying it as a discipline 4 years ago. I have a degree in International Trade and a Master's degree in International Affairs and Negotiations. I have worked as an analyst, specialized in international market research and business intelligence, and evolved as a project leader. Now, as a side project, I am looking for a way to incorporate machine learning techniques into the International Trade sphere in order to improve decision making, both in the public and private sector.

In addition to Data Science and Business Intelligence, I love hiking, photographing landscapes ([@trapast](https://www.instagram.com/trapast/)), wine tasting and, above all, learning new things. *"Wisdom is not a product of schooling but of the lifelong attempt to acquire it."*
